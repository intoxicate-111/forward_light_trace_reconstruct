# Zero-Set Forward Light Tracing

This experimental research prototype asks a deliberately narrow question: can samples of an analytic zero set act as local directional emitters, with the scalar field itself providing absorption and a finite detector providing an image? Version 0.1 isolates that forward mechanism. It contains no geometry learning, inverse rendering, or conventional lighting model, and it makes no claim of novelty.

## Model

Geometry is defined only by the zero level set

\[
S=\{x\in\mathbb R^3:F(x)=0\}.
\]

Crucially, **\(F\) is not assumed to be a signed distance function**: neither \(|F(x)|=d(x,S)\) nor \(\|\nabla F\|=1\) is used. Temporary points \(p_i\in S\) receive analytic coordinate colors and emit unit-speed photon packets around the normalized gradient \(n_i=\nabla F(p_i)/\|\nabla F(p_i)\|\). Directions follow \(p(\omega\mid n_i)\propto\max(0,n_i^T\omega)^k\), and each trajectory is

\[
x(t)=p_i+\omega t.
\]

The default is a synchronized pulse, \(t^{emit}=0\); a uniform finite interval is also available. Packet energy is recorded as \(1/M\) for \(M\) packets per emitter, while the specified first-arrival color rule is deliberately energy-independent.

```text

    |
    | emit
    v
photon trajectory
    |
    +---- hit zero set ---> absorbed
    |
    +---- hit camera -----> pixel
```

For a trajectory that intersects the finite detector at \(t^{cam}>0\), the tracer samples \(F(p+\omega t)\) over \((\epsilon,t^{cam}-\epsilon)\), takes the earliest sign-change bracket, and refines it by bisection. A root \(t^{surf}<t^{cam}\) absorbs the packet; otherwise its detector arrival is \(t^{emit}+t^{cam}\). This is the only visibility rule—there is no mesh collision, sphere tracing, or z-buffer pass. The detector is a physical rectangle with a center, orthonormal frame, width, height, and pixel resolution; ray-plane intersection is analytic.

Hard rendering assigns each pixel the color of its minimum-arrival packet. Soft diagnostic mode assigns packets in one pixel normalized weights

\[
w_j=\frac{\exp[-\beta(t_j-t_{min})]}{\sum_k\exp[-\beta(t_k-t_{min})]}.
\]

Both modes explicitly build a COO transport matrix and compute

\[
I=T(F)C.
\]

In hard mode, the winning pixel/emitter entry is one. In soft mode, \(T_{ui}\) is the sum of the normalized packet weights at pixel \(u\) emitted by point \(i\); duplicate COO entries are coalesced. The demo independently accumulates packet colors and checks the result against sparse matrix multiplication.

## Install and run

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python demo.py --scene sphere
python demo.py --scene torus
python demo.py --scene torus --mode soft
python demo.py --scene torus --verify
python demo.py --scene torus --output torus.png
```

The two implemented fields are exactly an analytic sphere and analytic torus. With the default seed, the sphere is the convex normal/camera sanity check. The side-view torus activates non-convex self-occlusion: some rays emitted from its inner wall cross the hole and re-intersect the opposite tube before reaching the detector. Every run reports zero-set and normal errors, hit and absorption fractions, sparse shape/nnz/density, operator fan-in/fan-out, direct-versus-sparse error, and measured pipeline runtime. `--verify` additionally runs deterministic hand checks for all acceptance gates through production code.

Useful controls are `--cone-power`, `--emission-interval`, `--beta`, `--emitters`, `--packets`, `--root-samples`, `--resolution`, and `--seed`. CPU execution is the reference path and uses float64 for transparent numerical checks.

## Limitations

Version 0.1 deliberately omits inverse optimization, differentiability through collision topology changes, dynamic geometry parameter birth, learned zero-set fields, secondary reflection, indirect illumination, refraction, participating media, physical camera lenses, and physically calibrated radiometry. It also misses tangent zero-set intersections that touch without a sign change. Emission sampling is a finite Monte Carlo diagnostic, detector misses produce no contribution, and only the two included analytic fields are supported.
